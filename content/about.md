I'm a Deep Thinker,
Amature Astrophysicist,
Cyber Security Researcher,
Professional Rabbit Hole Diver,
Coffee-induced Programmer, and
STEMer...woah that's a mouthful! I'm a jack of all trades. I've done it all, but mostly focused on **Cybersecurity** and **Astrophysics**.

**What will I specialize in? I don't know, and _that's exhilarating!_**

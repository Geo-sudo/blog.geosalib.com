I'm a Deep Thinker,
        Amature Astrophysicist,
        Cyber Security Researcher,
        Professional Rabbit Hole Diver,
        Coffee-induced Programmer, and
        STEMer...woah that's a mouthful! I'm a jack of all trades. I've done it all, but mostly focused on **Cybersecurity** and **Astrophysics**.
        
**What will I specialize in? I don't know, and *that's exhilarating!***

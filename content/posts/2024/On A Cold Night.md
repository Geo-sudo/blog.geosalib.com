As the trees dance with every gust,  
As the leaves orchestrate the sounds of thrusts,  
As the cold breeze stings with every touch,

As the void fills the view,  
As the beacons above guide me through,  
I wonder, will I make it though?

✦✦✦

Will I make it through this night?  
Will I make it to the next fight?  
Will I be enough to get through,  
Or will this one break me too?

✦✦✦

Under my feet, I ponder the paths,  
Carvings of beasts that came before.  
Should I follow the trails of previous mights,  
Or should I be one and carve my own?

✦✦✦

Above my head, I gaze at the lights,  
A map of gods set in the heights.  
Should I trace this starry masterpiece,  
Or should I only look where I can walk with ease?

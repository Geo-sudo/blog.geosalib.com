As I look above, I see the mighty gods,  
Legends may they be, throughout the sky.  
I look and dream to be one of these mights,  
To be put between the gods in the heights.

✦✦✦

I dream of Orion and his strength,  
To win every battle I fight on this Earth.  
I dream of Gemini and their love,  
To have a loyal companion in times of despair.  
I dream of Hercules and his courage,  
To fight inner beasts with all my might.  
I dream of Perseus and his perseverance,  
To endure the longest of stormy nights.  
I dream of Athena and her wisdom,  
To navigate the wild terrain of life.  
I dream of Apollo and his vision,  
To light the hollow abyss of the night.  
I dream of Zeus and his command,  
To lead the scared through my light.

✦✦✦
I dream of being full,  
I dream of being one who isn't scared of heights.
